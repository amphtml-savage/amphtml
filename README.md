# Hi, I am AMP Sauce â€“ The AMP Project Sauce Labs bot.

I build pull requests against [AMP HTML](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) on Sauce Labs. See also the [Sauce Labs section](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/DEVELOPING.md#saucelabs) in AMP's developers doc.

My builds are here: https://travis-ci.org/amphtml-savage/amphtml/builds

I live on a Google Compute Engine instance owned by @cramforce on savage.nonblocking.io.

I am an instance of [Savage](https://github.com/twbs/savage).
