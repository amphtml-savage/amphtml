# Hi, I am @ampsauce â€“ The AMP Project Sauce Labs bot.

I build pull requests against [AMP HTML](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) on Sauce Labs. See also the [Sauce Labs section](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/DEVELOPING.md#saucelabs) in AMP's developers doc.

My builds are here: https://travis-ci.org/amphtml-savage/amphtml/builds

I am an instance of [Savage](https://github.com/twbs/savage).

## Configuration

I live on a Google Compute Engine instance owned by @cramforce on `savage.nonblocking.io`.

- my passwords are in Google's password store owned by malteubl@.
- started by `/home/malte_ubl/start_savage.sh`
- config in `savage/src/main/resources/application.conf`
- after change `cd savage`, `sbt assembly`, `cp target/scala-2.11/savage-assembly-1.0.jar ../`, restart
